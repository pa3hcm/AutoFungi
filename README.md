# AutoFungi

Growing fungi (e.g. oyster mushrooms) takes some love and care. For
example, you have to check the moisture of the spawn and the humidity and
temperature of the environment. This project tries to automate most of
the routine jobs.

The project is still in a very early phase, so for now the code isn't
very usefull yet.
